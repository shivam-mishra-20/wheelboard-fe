# Vehicle Details Page - Status Badge & Lease Feature Implementation

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented the vehicle details page with dynamic status badges, ownership display, and a conditional lease toggle button based on the provided requirements.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Status Badges**

The vehicle status badge now dynamically displays based on driver assignment and trip status:

- **"In Transit"** - Displayed when:
  - A driver is assigned to the vehicle, AND
  - The vehicle is currently on a trip (`onTrip: true`)
  - Orange badge (bg-orange-100, text-orange-800)

- **"Assigned"** - Displayed when:
  - A driver is assigned to the vehicle, AND
  - The vehicle is NOT on a trip (`onTrip: false`)
  - Blue badge (bg-blue-100, text-blue-800)

- **"Available"** - Displayed when:
  - No driver is assigned to the vehicle
  - Gray badge (bg-gray-100, text-gray-800)

### 2. **Ownership Badge**

Added a separate ownership badge that displays alongside the status badge:

- **"Owned"** - Vehicle is owned by the company
  - Green badge (bg-green-100, text-green-800)

- **"Attached"** - Vehicle is attached/rented
  - Purple badge (bg-purple-100, text-purple-800)

### 3. **Conditional Lease Toggle Button**

The lease toggle button is now only visible when:

- Vehicle status badge is **"Available"** (no driver assigned), AND
- Vehicle ownership is **"Owned"** (not attached/rented)

This ensures that only available, company-owned vehicles can be put on lease.

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **`src/lib/mockApi.ts`**

- Updated `Vehicle` interface:
  - Changed `statusBadge` type to: `'Assigned' | 'Available' | 'In Transit'`
  - Added `ownership: 'Owned' | 'Attached'` field
  - Added `onTrip?: boolean` field to track active trips
  - Removed deprecated statuses like 'Off Lease'

- Updated all vehicle mock data entries with:
  - `ownership` field
  - `onTrip` field
  - Corrected `statusBadge` values

**Example vehicles in mock data:**

- **v1 (Omni Van)**: `statusBadge: 'In Transit'`, `ownership: 'Attached'`, `onTrip: true` - Has driver, on trip
- **v2 (Tata)**: `statusBadge: 'Assigned'`, `ownership: 'Owned'`, `onTrip: false` - Has driver, not on trip
- **v3 (Mercedes-Benz)**: `statusBadge: 'Available'`, `ownership: 'Owned'`, `onTrip: false` - No driver, available for lease
- **v4 (Tata LPT)**: `statusBadge: 'Available'`, `ownership: 'Owned'`, `onTrip: false` - No driver, available for lease
- **v5 (Ashok Leyland)**: `statusBadge: 'In Transit'`, `ownership: 'Owned'`, `onTrip: true` - Has driver, on trip

#### 2. **`src/components/company/VehicleInfoCard.tsx`**

- Updated status badge display logic:
  - Shows status badge with appropriate colors for In Transit, Assigned, and Available
  - Added ownership badge display next to status badge
  - Both badges are displayed side by side in the header

- Updated lease toggle condition:
  ```tsx
  {vehicle.statusBadge === 'Available' && vehicle.ownership === 'Owned' && (
    // Lease toggle UI
  )}
  ```

#### 3. **`src/app/company/fleet/vehicles/[id]/page.tsx`**

- Updated `handleLeaseSubmit` to maintain vehicle status when leasing
- Updated `handleLeaseRemove` to maintain vehicle status when removing lease
- Fixed TypeScript type issues using proper type assertions

## Lease Form Details

The lease form (already implemented in `LeaseVehicleModal.tsx`) includes all the fields shown in the provided image:

- Vehicle title and number
- Odometer readings (start and booking)
- Lease period (start and end dates)
- Pricing model (Flat price per day or KM-based)
- Monthly run estimate
- Top efficiency percentage
- Business days selector
- Business hours (start and end times)
- Additional instructions (optional)

## Visual Layout

The vehicle details page now displays:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [In Transit] [Owned]        Year: 1998  │ ← Status + Ownership badges
│                                          │

│ │ ┌──────────────────────────────┐  │  │ ← Only visible when

└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Testing Scenarios

To test the implementation, navigate to different vehicle detail pages:

- `/company/fleet/vehicles/v1` - Should show "In Transit" + "Attached", no lease button
- `/company/fleet/vehicles/v2` - Should show "Assigned" + "Owned", no lease button (driver assigned)
- `/company/fleet/vehicles/v3` - Should show "Available" + "Owned", lease button visible
- `/company/fleet/vehicles/v4` - Should show "Available" + "Owned", lease button visible
- `/company/fleet/vehicles/v5` - Should show "In Transit" + "Owned", no lease button

## Implementation Complete ✅

All requirements have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ Status badge shows "In Transit", "Assigned", or "Available" based on driver and trip status
- ✅ Ownership badge shows "Owned" or "Attached" separately
- ✅ Lease toggle button only appears for Available + Owned vehicles
- ✅ Driver assignment is properly displayed
- ✅ Lease form matches the provided design
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Mock data updated with proper examples
