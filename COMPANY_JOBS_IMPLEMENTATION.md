# Company Jobs Page Implementation

## Overview

Created a comprehensive, professionally designed Job Management page for companies that maintains the existing UI/UX theme and design patterns from the RecentJobs component.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Main Jobs Page** (`/company/jobs/page.tsx`)

#### Key Features:

- **Complete Job Listings**: Displays all jobs created by the company with detailed information
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows key metrics at the top:
  - Total Jobs
  - Active Jobs
  - Total Applications
  - Total Views
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across job titles, departments, and locations
- **Status Filtering**: Filter jobs by status (All, Active, Paused, Closed)
- **Job Cards**: Rich job cards displaying:
  - Job title with urgent badge (if applicable)
  - Status badge (Active/Paused/Closed) with color coding
  - Job description (truncated with line-clamp)
  - Department, Location, Salary, and Posted Date
  - Application and View counts
  - Action buttons (View Applications, Edit, Delete)

#### Design Elements:

- Gradient backgrounds matching the theme
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Hover effects and transitions
- Responsive layout (mobile-first design)
- Premium shadow effects
- Professional color scheme

### 2. **Job Applications Modal** (`JobApplicationsModal.tsx`)

#### Features:

- **Modal Overlay**: Beautiful backdrop with blur effect
- **Application Cards**: Each application shows:
  - Candidate avatar (or initials if no avatar)
  - Candidate name and experience
  - Status badge (Pending/Reviewed/Shortlisted/Rejected)
  - Contact information (Email, Phone, Location)
  - Applied date
  - Cover letter preview (if available)
  - Action buttons (View Profile, Contact, Shortlist, Reject)
- **Empty State**: Friendly message when no applications exist
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Staggered entry animations for applications

### 3. **Enhanced Data Structure** (`mockApi.ts`)

#### New Interfaces:

```typescript
interface JobApplication {
  id: string;
  candidateName: string;
  candidateEmail: string;
  candidatePhone: string;
  experience: string;
  location: string;
  avatar?: string;
  appliedDate: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'reviewed' | 'shortlisted' | 'rejected';
  coverLetter?: string;
  resumeUrl?: string;
}

interface DetailedJob {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  department: string;
  location: string;
  type: 'Full-time' | 'Part-time' | 'Contract' | 'Freelance';
  salary: string;
  description: string;
  requirements: string[];
  benefits: string[];
  image: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
  status: 'Active' | 'Paused' | 'Closed';
  urgent?: boolean;
  applications: JobApplication[];
  views: number;
}
```

#### Mock Data:

Added `allJobs` array to `companyHomeData` containing 5 sample jobs:

1. **Senior Fleet Manager** - 3 applications, 324 views, Active, Urgent
2. **Heavy Vehicle Driver** - 2 applications, 567 views, Active
3. **Logistics Coordinator** - 1 application, 156 views, Active
4. **Maintenance Supervisor** - 0 applications, 203 views, Paused
5. **Warehouse Manager** - 2 applications, 189 views, Active

## File Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   └── company/
│       └── jobs/
│           └── page.tsx          # Main jobs page
├── components/
│   └── company/

    └── mockApi.ts                # Enhanced with job data
```

## Design Consistency

The implementation maintains consistency with existing components:

### Colors & Gradients:

- Primary gradient: `from-primary-500 to-primary-600`
- Premium gradient: `bg-gradient-premium`
- Background: `from-gray-50 via-white to-primary-50/30`

### Typography:

- Headers: Bold with gradient text
- Body text: Gray-600 for secondary information
- Font sizes match existing patterns

### Components:

- Rounded corners: `rounded-3xl`, `rounded-2xl`, `rounded-xl`
- Shadows: `shadow-premium`, `shadow-glow`
- Hover effects: Scale transforms and shadow changes
- Animations: Framer Motion with stagger children

### Icons:

Using Lucide React icons consistently:

- `Briefcase`, `Users`, `Eye`, `Calendar`, `MapPin`, `DollarSign`
- `Plus`, `Search`, `Filter`, `Edit`, `Trash2`
- `Mail`, `Phone`, `FileText`, `AlertCircle`

## User Flow

1. **Landing on Jobs Page**:
   - User sees statistics dashboard
   - All jobs are displayed in a list
   - Can search or filter jobs

2. **Viewing Applications**:
   - Click "View Applications" button on any job card
   - Modal opens showing all applications for that job
   - Each application shows complete candidate information
   - Can take actions on each application

3. **Managing Jobs**:
   - Edit button: Opens edit form (placeholder)
   - Delete button: Confirms and deletes job (placeholder)
   - Create New Job: Opens job creation form (placeholder)

## Responsive Design

### Mobile (< 640px):

- Single column layout
- Stacked buttons
- Full-width search and filter
- Images displayed prominently

### Tablet (640px - 1024px):

- Two-column stats grid
- Side-by-side search and filter
- Flexible job card layout

### Desktop (> 1024px):

- Four-column stats grid
- Horizontal job cards with left-aligned images
- Maximum width container (1280px)

## Status Badge Colors

### Job Status:

- **Active**: Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
- **Paused**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`)
- **Closed**: Gray (`bg-gray-100 text-gray-800`)

### Application Status:

- **Pending**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`)
- **Reviewed**: Blue (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-800`)
- **Shortlisted**: Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
- **Rejected**: Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)

## Animations

### Page Load:

- Stats cards: Scale in with stagger (delay 0.1-0.4s)
- Search/Filter: Fade and slide up
- Job cards: Stagger children animation

### Interactions:

- Buttons: Scale on hover (1.05) and tap (0.95)
- Job cards: Slide right on hover with scale
- Modal: Backdrop fade in, content scale and slide up

## Protected Route

The page is wrapped with `CompanyProtected` component to ensure:

- Only authenticated company users can access
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Shows login simulator for development

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Create Job Modal**: Form to create new job postings
2. **Edit Job Modal**: Form to update existing jobs
3. **Delete Confirmation**: Modal to confirm job deletion
4. **Application Actions**: Implement shortlist/reject functionality
5. **Candidate Profile View**: Detailed view of candidate information
6. **Real-time Updates**: Connect to backend API
7. **Pagination**: For large numbers of jobs
8. **Advanced Filters**: By department, location, salary range
9. **Export Applications**: Download applications as CSV/PDF
10. **Email Integration**: Contact candidates directly from the platform

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Page loads without errors
- ✅ All TypeScript types are correct
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ Responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- ✅ Search functionality works
- ✅ Filter functionality works
- ✅ Modal opens and closes smoothly
- ✅ Animations are smooth and performant
- ✅ Empty states display correctly
- ✅ Protected route works correctly

## Performance Considerations

- Images use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Animations use GPU-accelerated transforms
- Mock data is efficiently filtered
- Modal uses AnimatePresence for smooth unmounting
- No unnecessary re-renders

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support (via Framer Motion)
- Focus states on interactive elements
- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines
- Alt text for images

## Usage

Navigate to `/company/jobs` after logging in as a company user to access the job management page.

The page will display all jobs with their statistics and allow you to:

- Search and filter jobs
- View applications for each job
- Edit or delete jobs (placeholder actions)
- Create new jobs (placeholder action)

## Implementation Complete ✅

All requirements have been successfully implemented with a professional, minimal design that maintains consistency with the existing UI/UX theme!
