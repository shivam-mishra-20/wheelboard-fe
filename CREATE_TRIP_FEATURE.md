## Features

### Form Step

The form collects the following information:

- **Select Vehicle**: Dropdown with available vehicles from fleet
- **Pickup Location**: Text input for origin address
- **Delivery Location**: Text input for destination address
- **Pick up a Date**: Date picker for pickup date
- **Pick Time**: Time picker for pickup time
- **Special Instructions**: Textarea for additional notes (optional)
- **Pay Range**: Text input for payment range (e.g., "Rs 200- Rs 900")

### Confirmation Step

- Displays all entered information in an organized review format
- Shows vehicle details with icon
- Shows route (pickup â†’ delivery)
- Shows pickup schedule with formatted date and time
- Shows pay range
- Shows special instructions (if provided)
- Two action buttons:
  - **Edit Trip**: Returns to form step
  - **Post Trip**: Creates the trip and closes modal

### User Flow

1. User clicks "New Trip" floating button (bottom-right corner)
2. Modal opens with form step
3. User fills in required fields (vehicle, locations, date, time)
4. User clicks "Continue" button
5. Modal transitions to confirmation step
6. User reviews information
7. User can either:
   - Click "Edit Trip" to go back and modify
   - Click "Post Trip" to create the trip
8. On posting:
   - Trip is created (currently simulated)
   - Modal closes
   - Page switches to "Upcoming" tab
   - Success toast appears at bottom-center

## Design Elements

### Animations

- **Modal Entry**: Smooth fade and slide animations using Framer Motion
- **Step Transitions**: Horizontal slide transitions between form and confirmation
- **Success Toast**: Scale and fade animation
- **Button Interactions**: Scale on hover/tap using Framer Motion

### Color Scheme

- **Primary Actions**: Gradient from `#f36969` (primary-500) to `#f85959` (primary-600)
- **Secondary Actions**: White background with gray border
- **Success Toast**: Green-600 background
- **Icons**: Primary-500 color (#f36969)

### Responsive Design

- Modal is responsive with `max-w-md` width
- Form fields stack vertically for mobile compatibility
- Max height `90vh` with overflow scroll for small screens

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
const [isCreateModalOpen, setIsCreateModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [showSuccessToast, setShowSuccessToast] = useState(false);
const [step, setStep] = useState<'form' | 'confirmation'>('form');
```

### Data Flow

1. Form data stored in local state (`formData`)
2. On "Continue", validates required fields
3. On "Post Trip", calls `onTripCreated()` callback
4. Callback switches tab and shows success notification
5. Modal resets state and closes

### Validation

- Checks all required fields before allowing "Continue"
- Alert shown if validation fails
- Required fields: vehicle, pickup location, delivery location, date, time

## Integration Points

### Props Interface

```typescript
interface CreateTripModalProps {
  open: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onTripCreated: () => void;
  vehicles: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string;
    registrationNumber: string;
  }>;
}
```

### Vehicle Data Source

- Vehicles fetched from `companyFleetData.vehicles` in `mockApi.ts`
- Each vehicle has `id`, `name`, and `registrationNumber`
