# Business Jobs Page Implementation

## Overview

Redesigned the Business Jobs page to match the Company Jobs page design and flow, with a key restriction: **Business can only post jobs for Technician and Helper roles** (Driver is excluded).

## Implementation Date

January 2025

## Key Changes

### 1. Business Jobs Page (`src/app/business/jobs/page.tsx`)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (701 lines)

**Features:**

- Professional gradient-themed layout matching Wheelboard brand (#f36969)
- Stats cards showing Total Jobs, Active Jobs, Applications, and Views
- Search and filter functionality
- Animated job cards with Framer Motion (hover effects, stagger animations)
- Job card structure:
  - Image section with gradient overlay
  - Meta information grid (Department, Location, Salary, Date)
  - Stats bar (applications count, views count)
  - Edit and Delete action buttons
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Toast notifications with auto-hide (3 seconds)
- Modal integrations (CreateJobModal, ConfirmDeleteModal)
- Urgent job badge for priority positions

**Mock Data:**
Three initial jobs included:

1. **Automotive Technician** (Urgent)
   - Location: Mumbai, Maharashtra
   - Salary: ‚Çπ25,000 - ‚Çπ35,000/month
   - Type: Full-time

2. **Vehicle Helper**
   - Location: Delhi, NCR
   - Salary: ‚Çπ15,000 - ‚Çπ20,000/month
   - Type: Part-time

3. **Diesel Mechanic**
   - Location: Bangalore, Karnataka
   - Salary: ‚Çπ30,000 - ‚Çπ40,000/month
   - Type: Full-time

**Design Elements:**

- Pink gradient background: `from-pink-50 via-white to-red-50`
- Accent color: `#f36969` (Wheelboard primary)
- Rounded cards with shadow effects
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop)
- Smooth page transitions and animations

### 2. CreateJobModal Component (`src/components/company/CreateJobModal.tsx`)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Updated (468 lines)

**Key Modification:**
Added optional `allowedJobTypes` prop to restrict job type selection.

**Interface Change:**

```typescript
interface CreateJobModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onSubmit: (jobData: JobFormData & { id?: string }) => void;
  initialData?: Partial<JobFormData & { id?: string }> | null;
  mode?: 'create' | 'edit';
  allowedJobTypes?: ('Driver' | 'Technician' | 'Helper')[]; // NEW PROP
}
```

**Default Behavior:**

- If `allowedJobTypes` is not provided, defaults to `['Driver', 'Technician', 'Helper']`
- Ensures backward compatibility with Company Jobs page (no changes required)

**Usage in Business:**

```typescript
<CreateJobModal
  isOpen={isCreateJobModalOpen}
  onClose={handleClose}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  allowedJobTypes={['Technician', 'Helper']} // Restricts to only these 2 types
/>
```

**Usage in Company:**

```typescript
<CreateJobModal
  isOpen={isCreateJobModalOpen}
  onClose={handleClose}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  // No allowedJobTypes prop = all 3 types available (Driver, Technician, Helper)
/>
```

**Implementation Details:**

- Job type buttons are dynamically filtered based on `allowedJobTypes`
- Only allowed types are rendered in the modal
- Business users will only see "Technician" and "Helper" buttons
- Company users will see all three buttons

## Business Logic

### Job Type Restrictions

| Role     | Driver | Technician | Helper |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Company  | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ     |
| Business | ‚ùå     | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ     |

**Rationale:**

- **Company**: Can hire all types of staff including drivers for their fleet operations
- **Business**: Typically service providers (repair shops, maintenance centers) who need technicians and helpers but not drivers

### CRUD Operations

**Create:**

1. User clicks "Post a Job" button
2. CreateJobModal opens with restricted job types (Technician/Helper)
3. User fills in job details (duration, openings, salary, city, type, description, images)
4. Modal has 2 steps:
   - Step 1: Job details and basic information
   - Step 2: Additional information and image upload
5. On submit, new job is added to the jobs array
6. Toast notification confirms creation
7. Job card appears in the grid with animation

**Read:**

- Jobs displayed in a responsive grid
- Each card shows key information: image, title, department, location, salary, date
- Stats bar shows views and applications count
- Search bar filters by job title
- Filter dropdown filters by status (All/Active/Paused/Closed)

**Update (Edit):**

1. User clicks Edit button on job card
2. CreateJobModal opens in "edit" mode with pre-filled data
3. User modifies desired fields
4. On submit, job data is updated in the jobs array
5. Toast notification confirms update
6. Job card reflects new information

**Delete:**

1. User clicks Delete button on job card
2. ConfirmDeleteModal opens with warning message
3. User confirms deletion
4. Job is removed from the jobs array
5. Toast notification confirms deletion
6. Job card is removed from grid with animation

## Technical Stack

**Frontend:**

- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- React Hooks (useState)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Lucide React (icons)

**Components Used:**

- `BusinessProtected` - Route protection wrapper
- `LoginSimulator` - Dev mode login simulation
- `Header` - Navigation header
- `Footer` - Page footer
- `CreateJobModal` - Job creation/editing modal (shared with Company)
- `ConfirmDeleteModal` - Delete confirmation dialog (shared with Company)

**Icons:**

- Plus - Add new job
- Search - Search functionality
- Filter - Filter dropdown
- Eye - View count
- Users - Application count
- Calendar - Date posted
- MapPin - Location
- Briefcase - Job type/department
- DollarSign - Salary
- Edit - Edit action
- Trash2 - Delete action
- AlertCircle - Urgent badge

## Animations

**Page Load:**

- Container uses stagger animation
- Each job card fades in with upward motion
- Stagger delay: 0.1s between cards

**Hover Effects:**

- Job cards scale up slightly (1.01x) and shift right (4px)
- Image scales up (1.05x) within the card
- Smooth transitions with Framer Motion

**Toast Notifications:**

- Slide up from bottom-right
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
- Fade out animation on close

**Modal:**

- Fade in/out background overlay
- Slide in content from right (Step 1)
- Slide animations between steps

## Responsive Design

**Breakpoints:**

- **Mobile (<640px):** 1 column grid
- **Tablet (640px-1024px):** 2 column grid
- **Desktop (>1024px):** 3 column grid

**Adaptive Elements:**

- Stats cards stack on mobile, row on desktop
- Search and filter stack on mobile, inline on desktop
- Job cards adjust padding and spacing
- Modal is full-screen on mobile, centered on desktop

## State Management

**Local State:**

```typescript
const [jobs, setJobs] = useState<BusinessJob[]>(initialJobs);
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [filterStatus, setFilterStatus] = useState('All');
const [isCreateJobModalOpen, setIsCreateJobModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [isEditMode, setIsEditMode] = useState(false);
const [jobToEdit, setJobToEdit] = useState<BusinessJob | null>(null);
const [isDeleteModalOpen, setIsDeleteModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [jobToDelete, setJobToDelete] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [toast, setToast] = useState<{
  type: 'success' | 'error';
  message: string;
} | null>(null);
```

**Data Flow:**

1. User action triggers state update
2. State change re-renders affected components
3. Animations play during re-render
4. Toast notification appears if applicable

## Consistency with Company Jobs

**Matching Elements:**

- ‚úÖ Same gradient theme (adapted to pink for Business)
- ‚úÖ Same stats cards layout
- ‚úÖ Same search/filter UI
- ‚úÖ Same job card structure
- ‚úÖ Same modal integrations
- ‚úÖ Same CRUD flow
- ‚úÖ Same animation patterns
- ‚úÖ Same toast notifications

**Unique Differences:**

- ‚ùå Job type restriction (Technician/Helper only)
- üé® Pink color scheme (#f36969) vs Company colors
- üìä Different initial mock data (service-related jobs)
